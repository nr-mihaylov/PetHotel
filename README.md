# Pet Paradise Hotel – mandatory assignment

Animal hotel "Pets Paradise hotel" specializes in offering holidays to many kinds of pets, such as dog, cat,
rabbit, guinea pig, budgie, chinchilla, hamster, snake, and spider.
Prices per. day are established at:
- Chinchilla 80,00
- Snake 120,00
- Hamster 80,00
- Dog 180,00
- Cat 140,00
- Rabit 80,00
- Iguanas 150,00
- Guinea pig 75,00
- Canary 60,00
- Bird spider 90,00
The web application must present Pet Paradise Hotel for customers and support online reservation. The
reservation system must keep track of customers and their lodged animals. Upon collection of pets, it must
be possible to print an invoice. Moreover, it should be possible on daily basis to generate a list with name,
species, and age on lodged animals.
You are supposed to build an early prototype in the first part of the assignment. In this assignment, you
must demonstrate that you are able to write and instantiate classes and display data in a basic way inside
an ASP.NET MVC web application. At this point data are stored as non-persistent sample data inside the
program itself. In addition, there will be no administration part with HTML forms for data input and
maintenance (this we will add later)
In assignment two, we will design a great looking website for Pet Paradise Hotel with a reservation page
(forms) and an administration part.
You can do the assignment individually or in small groups of two or three persons. You must upload the
assignment to Fronter (in the Hand-in folder) as a .zip file containing all project files. The default page of
the website – which loads when you run the project – must have links to the webpages that are part of the
solution.
The assignment must be approved in order to go to the examination in the Backend
Programming module
